# CPTServiceApi
When employing the CPT Service in an application, each call to the service would require a series of commands to create, send and consume a web request. Through abstraction, this code can be modularized to prevent code clones, unnecessary code replication which degrades software maintainability. For this reason, the CPT Sevice API was created to provide a module which could be used specifically in Java applications which would rely on the CPT Service. The implementation is still na{\"i}ve and replicates the model code used by the CPT Service. This code should be extracted into its own package and included as a dependency in each of the CPT Service and CPT Service API modules. Further, work could be invested in developing an executable from the CPT Service API to test it against a CPT Service deployment. This requires some investment in understanding maven and the construction of executable java archives (JARS) and the linking, internally or externally, to dependencies. During prototype implementation in this project challenges with Maven linking resulted in developing the integration into OSCAR with raw code rather than by packaging the CPT Service API as a JAR and including it as a dependency in OSCAR's Maven (OSCAR's build tool) pom.xml file (the Maven configuration file).
